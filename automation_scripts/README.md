# Automated shell scripts

#### After the simple shell project, i decided to deepen my knowlege of shell scripting by taking on some shell scripting challenge.
#### using shell scripts to display all installed apps in a computer system, whether it is a windows or unix environment.
#### a shell script that automatically does the gcc compile in C language, with all the neccessary flags, for single or multiple files. It displays an error message if no files are provided
